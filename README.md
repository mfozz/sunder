# Sunder
Add some literal crunch to your game! This D&D 5e module breaks weapons on fumbles and breaks armor on crits, both with customizable thresholds. Repair items by clicking the hammer icon in the item's header or by using a macro. Whether you're running a gritty campaign or just want gear to feel more dynamic, Sunder has you covered.

## Features
- **Breakage Mechanics:** Trigger weapon breakage on low rolls and armor/shield breakage on high rolls with configurable thresholds.
- **Two-Stage Breakage:** Transition items from Undamaged → Damaged → Broken. Durability decrements by 1 per hit until reaching 0. At durability 0, the item is broken.
- **Durability Tracking:** Assign durability based on item rarity, reducing it on failed breakage rolls.
- **Heavy Weapon Bonus:** Add a configurable bonus to breakage rolls for heavy weapons.
- **Repair System:** Use the "Repair" button on item sheets (GM-only), with costs based on a percentage of the original price, doubled for broken items, and deducted gold from PCs if available.
- **Penalties:** Apply attack-roll penalties to damaged/broken weapons and AC penalties to damaged/broken armor, doubling for broken states.
- **Audio Feedback:** Play customizable sounds for breakage attempts, successes, and failures.
- **Settings:** Adjust many aspects of the module to fit your needs.
- **Localization:** Support translations through en.json.
- **UI Enhancements:** Breakage popup shows an item preview with an icon and a color-coded status (orange for Damaged).
- **Targeting Logic:** Prioritize shields and skip broken items.
- **MIDI Support:** Use it with both the vanilla D&D 5e and MIDI QOL workflows.
- **Macro Included:** Use the bundled "Repair Macro" for quick repair actions on selected tokens or for PC visits to the blacksmith.
